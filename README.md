The dataset used in this project was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone).

## Introduction
### Abalone
Abalone are type of shellfish that are common along the coasts of most continents across the world. By cutting through the shell of an abalone, its age can be determined by counting the number of rings using a microscope. It's burdensome process so we try to do this using  a number of explanatory factors, like height or weight.  
  
### Multi-layer Perceptron
